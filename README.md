# Maze Solver

![mazeSolverGif](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/acf4d4a1-6e2a-4040-88d0-d360d7e9875b)

This project implements a maze generator and solver using Python. The maze is visualized with Tkinter, and the maze is solved using a recursive algorithm.

## Features

- Maze generation using a randomized recursive backtracking algorithm.
- Visualization of maze creation and solving steps.
- Graphical user interface using Tkinter.

## Prerequisites

To run this project, you need Python installed on your machine. The project uses the following libraries:

- `tkinter` (comes pre-installed with Python)
- `random` (comes pre-installed with Python)
- `time` (comes pre-installed with Python)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Swapnilgupta8585/maze_solver.git
   cd maze-solver
    ```
2. **Ensure Python is installed:**
    -This project uses Python 3. Make sure Python 3 is installed on your system. You can download it from `python.org`.

## Usage

1. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   ```bash
   cd path/to/maze-solver
    ```
2. **(Optional) Make the script executable:**
    This step is optional but recommended for convenience:
    ```bash
    chmod +x main.sh
    ```
3. **Run the script to start the program:**
    ```bash
    ./main.sh
    ```
4. This script will execute the Python program and open a window displaying the maze generation and solving process.

Thank You.
